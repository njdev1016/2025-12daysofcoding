On the fourth day of coding my team lead sent to me... Four dining elves,

Three security rules, two pointers, and a nasty bug in a production tree!

Mr. Frost looks exhausted. "We have a situation in the cafeteria. Four elves - Jingle, Sparkle, Tinsel, and Holly - are sitting around a circular table trying to eat lunch. There are four forks on the table, one between each pair of elves. Each elf needs TWO forks to eat (the one on their left AND the one on their right)."

He pulls up a log on his screen. "The problem is, they keep trying to grab forks that other elves are already using. Every time an elf attempts to pick up a fork that's currently held by someone else, it causes a 'contention' - they have to wait, complain, and it slows everything down."

"I need you to analyze this log and count how many contentions occurred during lunch. Help me figure out how bad the problem really is."

Input: logs of actions separated by newline. Each log contains name of the elf, action (pick or release) and an id of a fork, all separated by comma. Example: Jingle,pick,3
Output: Total number of contentions (attempts to pick up a fork that's already held by another elf).

Order of elves and forks around the table:

Jingle - Fork_1 - Sparkle - Fork_2 - Tinsel - Fork_3 - Holly - Fork_4 - (back to) Jingle


Hint:
1. from threading import Lock ;-)
2. Don't worry about the elf name's, you need to track just the Spoon num & the status (Pick / Release). Easy to solve this with HashMap.
3. According to the condition, each elf can use the forks that are on both sides of him. What happens if he tries to use another fork that is currently free. As an example, the log Jingle,pick,3 is given - according to the condition Jingle can use fork 1 and 4? :)
4. There are four fork slots. Each one is free at first. If it is picked, and someone tries to pick it again, then increase contention count. Array of 4 booleans works well. Ignore things like who is picking the fork
