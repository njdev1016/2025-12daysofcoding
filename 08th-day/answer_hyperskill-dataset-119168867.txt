Queen positions:
  Queen 1: (4,0) - Row 4, Column 0
  Queen 2: (1,4) - Row 1, Column 4
  Queen 3: (6,5) - Row 6, Column 5
  Queen 4: (0,1) - Row 0, Column 1
  Queen 5: (3,3) - Row 3, Column 3
  Queen 6: (5,7) - Row 5, Column 7
  Queen 7: (2,6) - Row 2, Column 6
  Queen 8: (7,2) - Row 7, Column 2

How it checks:
1. Same row: Compares row indices - no two queens have the same row
2. Same column: Compares column indices - no two queens have the same column
3. Main diagonal (↘): Queens on same diagonal have constant (row - col) - all values are unique
4. Anti-diagonal (↙): Queens on same diagonal have constant (row + col) - all values are unique

The solution checks all 28 pairs of queens (combination of 8 choose 2) and found 0 conflicts!
