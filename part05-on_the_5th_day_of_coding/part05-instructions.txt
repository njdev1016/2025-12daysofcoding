On The Fifth Day Of Coding...

On the fifth day of coding my team lead sent to me... Five-pointed star,

Four dining elves, three security rules, two pointers, and a nasty bug in a production tree!

Mr. Frost walks in holding a sheet of graph paper covered in coordinate points. "We're decorating the office for the winter festival. I've been designing 5-pointed stars to hang from the ceiling, but I need to order the right amount of golden fabric to cover them. Each star is defined by 10 points - 5 outer points (the tips) and 5 inner points (where the edges meet). I need you to calculate the total area so I know how much material to buy."
He hands you a file with coordinates.

Input format: 10 lines, each containing a coordinate pair in format x,y (the points alternate between outer (tip) and inner points as you traverse the star's perimeter)
Output: The area of the star, rounded to 2 decimal places

Hints:
1. My Locale was outputting the area in xxx,xx using comma and even though the result was correct it was not accepted.
Use (.) dot
System.out.printf(Locale.ENGLISH, "%.2f", pentagramArea);
2. Shoelace formula will help: result = (1 / 2) *  ((i = 0, i -> n - 1), result += |((x_i * y_(i + 1)) - (x_(i + 1) * y_i))|
3. For simplicity, form shoe holes using 2 arrays, the array containing all the X(s) coordindates, while the other for the Y(s) coordinates
4. Loop through the elements in order to sum all the x[i] * y[(i+1) % arraySize)] AND the sum of  y[i] * x[(i+1) % arraySize)] where `(i+1) % arraySize` allow u to traverse back to the first element when reaching the last one
5. Finally, absolute the DIFF of 2 sums and divide by 2
6. Do not forget to round up to 2 DECIMAL PLACES
