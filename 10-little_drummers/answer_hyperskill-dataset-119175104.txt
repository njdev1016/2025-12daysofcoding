32

Final Answer: 32 beats

The longest contiguous rhythm pattern that appears in ALL 10 drummers' sequences is 32 beats long.

The common pattern:
0,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

Pattern breakdown:
- Length: 32 beats
- Pattern: rest,rest,hit,rest,hit,hit,hit,rest,hit,hit,rest,rest,rest,rest,hit,rest,hit,hit,rest,hit,hit,hit,hit,rest,hit,rest,rest,rest,rest,rest,hit,rest

Positions in each drummer's sequence:
  Drummer 1: Found at position 23
  Drummer 2: Found at position 30
  Drummer 3: Found at position 27
  Drummer 4: Found at position 16
  Drummer 5: Found at position 24
  Drummer 6: Found at position 19
  Drummer 7: Found at position 10
  Drummer 8: Found at position 23
  Drummer 9: Found at position 17
  Drummer 10: Found at position 11

How the solution works:
This is a Longest Common Substring problem. The algorithm:
1. Takes the first drummer's sequence as reference
2. Tries all possible substring lengths, starting from longest (100 beats) down to 1
3. For each length, checks all substrings of that length
4. Verifies if the substring appears in ALL 10 drummers' sequences
5. Returns the first (longest) match found

All 10 drummers can play this 32-beat rhythm together without relearning their parts!
