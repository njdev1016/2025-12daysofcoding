28

Final Answer: 28 beats

The longest contiguous rhythm pattern that appears in ALL 10 drummers' sequences is 28 beats long.

The common pattern:
1,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0

Pattern breakdown:
- Length: 28 beats
- Pattern: hit,hit,rest,hit,rest,hit,hit,rest,hit,hit,hit,rest,hit,rest,rest,rest,hit,rest,hit,rest,rest,hit,rest,hit,rest,hit,rest,rest

Positions in each drummer's sequence:
  Drummer 1: Found at position 24
  Drummer 2: Found at position 20
  Drummer 3: Found at position 28
  Drummer 4: Found at position 13
  Drummer 5: Found at position 23
  Drummer 6: Found at position 19
  Drummer 7: Found at position 23
  Drummer 8: Found at position 18
  Drummer 9: Found at position 17
  Drummer 10: Found at position 13

How the solution works:
This is a Longest Common Substring problem. The algorithm:
1. Takes the first drummer's sequence as reference
2. Tries all possible substring lengths, starting from longest (90 beats) down to 1
3. For each length, checks all substrings of that length
4. Verifies if the substring appears in ALL 10 drummers' sequences
5. Returns the first (longest) match found

All 10 drummers can play this 28-beat rhythm together without relearning their parts!
